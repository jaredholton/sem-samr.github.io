SAMR is a special interest group operating within the Society for Ethnomusicology. It is a collection of scholars dedicated to learning more about Arab music, broadly defined, and the cultural production of the Middle East, North Africa, the Muslim world, and its diaspora.

In addition to this page and its annual meeting at the SEM national conference, the organization hosts an email list. Contact the current president for more information.
