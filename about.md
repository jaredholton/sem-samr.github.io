SAMR is a special interest group operating within the Society for Ethnomusicology. It is a collection of scholars dedicated to learning more about Arab music, broadly defined, and the cultural production of the Middle East, North Africa, the Muslim world, and its diaspora.

In addition to this page and its annual meeting at the SEM national conference, the organization hosts an email list. Contact the current president for more information.

# SEM Panel Sponsorship

Each year, SAMR is able to organize and sponsor panels submitted for the Society for Ethnomusicology Annual Meeting. While sponsorship does not increase the chances of a paper being accepted, the exchanges and discussions that go into planning have been shown to be helpful according to SEM.

The following list of past sponsored SEM panels, roundtables, and other events demonstrates the thematic and geographic diversity that SAMR supports.
