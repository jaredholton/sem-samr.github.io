SAMR is a special interest group operating within the Society for Ethnomusicology. It is a collection of scholars dedicated to learning more about Arab music, broadly defined, and the cultural production of the Middle East, North Africa, the Muslim world, and its diaspora.

In addition to this page and its annual meeting at the SEM national conference, the organization hosts an email list. Contact the current chair for more information.

## Membership

SAMR is open to anyone. While business meetings generally happen within the annual meeting for the Society for Ethnomusicology, much of the oganization's discussion occurs within an email list.

This site includes a roster of members who have shared their information. If you would like to add your own information, follow the directions listed on the [Members page](/members/).

## SEM Panel Sponsorship

Each year, SAMR sponsors fully-formed panels or roundtables on or relevant to Arab music for submission to the Society for Ethnomusicology's (SEM) annual meetings, following SEM guidelines. SAMR also networks people with individual proposals to form panels. All submissions undergo internal review that may include suggestions for revision. While sponsorship does not guarantee that a panel will be accepted by SEM, the exchanges and discussions in the review process tend to increase the strength of a panel and its chances of being accepted.

To see the titles of all papers presented at SEM conferences for past years on topics related to Arab music, see the pages listed here:
