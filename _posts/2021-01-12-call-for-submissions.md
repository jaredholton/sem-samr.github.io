  Call for Submissions - Individual Abstracts and Panel Sponsorship - SEM
  Conference 2021
---
The Society for Arab Music Research Special Interest Group seeks to sponsor individual papers and organized sessions (panels and/or roundtables) to be submitted for consideration for the 2021 Society for Ethnomusicology conference, currently scheduled for 28-31 October in Atlanta, Georgia.
 
As usual, we are happy to sponsor fully formed panels/roundtables on or relevant to Arab music, or to assist in helping people with individual proposals connect to form panels. If you have ideas for themed panels or roundtable discussions, feel free to share them with us as soon as you can so we can coordinate our efforts. To get started, we are suggesting a few pertinent topics:
 
1. The Legacies of Arab Music and Musicians Outside the MENA Region
2. Sonic Consequences in Post-2011 Arab Geographies
3. Modal Music and Their Ecologies
4. Transnational Heritage and Preservation in the Contemporary Arab World
5. Mediterranean Migration and Transplacement: Musical Remembrances
6. Disentangling Orientalism from Arab Music Studies
 
Please send your complete proposal to [societyforarabmusicresearch@gmail.com](mailto:societyforarabmusicresearch@gmail.com). The deadline for submission is Monday, 25 January at 11:59pm Eastern Standard Time for individual abstracts and Monday, 8 February at 11:59pm Eastern Standard Time for organized panels. These deadlines will allow us to review your proposal and to communicate with you prior to the SEM submission deadline of 17 February 2021. 
 
You may find a complete description of the expectations for organized panels and roundtables, as well as guidance for writing proposals, [here](https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.ethnomusicology.org/resource/resmgr/2021_annual_meeting/cfp_sem_2021_final_120420.pdf).
 
Please note that SAMR sponsorship does not guarantee that your paper/panel will be accepted in the SEM Annual Meeting Program. However, at the very least, getting feedback on your abstract may be useful, and SAMRâ€™s sponsored panels tend to be well attended at the conference. 
 
We look forward to receiving your proposals. 
 
Sincerely,

Guilnard Moufarrej
