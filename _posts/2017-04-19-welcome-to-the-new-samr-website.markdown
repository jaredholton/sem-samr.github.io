The new SAMR page is (almost) live! This project is an effort to centralize useful information about scholars and scholarship on music in the Arab world. The page has three main features, as described below.

 At this time, I invite you to browse the page and, if you feel so inclined, to send me your information for the membership listings. As a second request, I would love to incorporate photos from members in posts and elsewhere across the site. Please let me know if you would like to contribute some of your own images.

Thank you for reading and do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or comments.

### Blog Posts

Blog posts will include updates about our organization and occasional contributions from members. As this evolves, it may operate similarly to the group's Facebook page, though it will likely prove most helpful as we approach the annual Society for Ethnomusicology national conference.

### Membership Listing

A [membership list]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link members.md %}) will present information on those who are engaged in the SAMR community. You are free to supply your own information to me via email at [cwituls@bgsu.edu](mailto:cwituls@bgsu.edu) or using the link on the member page. As we get started, membership listings are set up to allow for basic information (including title and affiliation), methods of getting in touch (email and websites), a short description of your interests, and a listing of a few projects or publications. Each piece of information is optional, so you can share as little or as much as you like. This is voluntary and does not represent, for example, everyone on the email list or who attended the last SEM meeting.

### Resources

Collaborative [resource listings]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link resources.md %}) provide bibliographic information on books, articles, and other sources that are useful entries into various topics related to the music of the region's communities. These are intended to be open-ended and I invite anyone to suggest or request new categories or sources so that we can build a productive series of gateways. I think of these as the types of materials that would serve a graduate seminar on various topics, but types of categories and roles that these resource lists serve will doubtlessly shift organically over time.
