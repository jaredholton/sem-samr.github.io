Dear Colleagues,

I am happy to announce that after a close election, Dr. Guilnard Moufarrej will be taking over as SAMR chair-elect for the next year. Guilnard’s position will change to "chair" upon the election of a new chair-elect, most likely following our next meeting at SEM in Ottawa in October. Thanks to Dr. Andrea Shaheen for generously agreeing to stand for the election, and to everyone who participated.

On another note, as we approach the New Year - and conference-abstract-writing season -  please consider submitting your 2020 SEM paper, panel, or special event for sponsorship by the Society for Arab Music Research. I will send out relevant details and deadlines next week.

Until then, congratulations and welcome again to Guilnard,

Beau
