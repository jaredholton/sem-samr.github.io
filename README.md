6. Point your DNS to GitHub Pages.

You can now go back to your site on CloudFlare and click “DNS” at the top. From here you’re going to want to add a CNAME record. The first value (name) will be “@” and the second value (domain name) will be username.github.io, where username is your username on GitHub.

Unless you have some subdomains or other special circumstances, you can delete any other CNAME or A records off of CloudFlare. Just to be safe though, I’d suggest you backup your DNS records by clicking, “Advanced” and “Export.”

I personally don’t like the “www” that prefixes a lot of domains. I get rid of this by adding another CNAME record with first value “www” and second value username.github.io, where username is your username on GitHub.
